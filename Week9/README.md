# Week 9: System Design and Software Engineering

Congratulations on making it to Week 9 of the full-stack curriculum! This week, we’ll be shifting gears from hands-on coding to exploring the broader concepts that underpin robust, scalable, and maintainable software systems. Understanding system design and software engineering principles is crucial for building applications that can grow and adapt to real-world demands.
